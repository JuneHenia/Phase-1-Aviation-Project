# Aviation Accident Analysis Project

## **Overview**

This project explores **aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023** to generate insights for **aircraft purchase decisions and operational safety recommendations** as the company considers entering the aviation industry.

* **Data Source:** Kaggle (National Transportation Safety Board dataset)
* **Scope:** Civil aviation accidents in the US, its territories, and international waters

---

## **Data Cleaning and Preparation**

The dataset was cleaned by:

* Handling missing values strategically (**mode** or **'Missing'**)
* Removing or capping outliers using the **IQR method**
* Narrowing focus to **top aircraft makes and models** for clear insights
* Analyzing **engine types, weather conditions, and purpose of flight** for operational context

---

## **Key Findings**

* Accident frequency has **decreased over the years**, indicating improving safety standards
* Some aircraft makes and models have **higher accident frequencies** but also **higher uninjured passenger counts**, suggesting robust safety features
* **Weather conditions** and **flight phases** significantly impact safety outcomes
* **Engine type** and **purpose of flight** influence accident rates

---

## **Recommendations**

1. **Aircraft Selection:**
   Prioritize aircraft makes, models, and engine types with **high uninjured passenger counts**, indicating stronger safety performance.

2. **Operational Focus:**
   Enhance **pilot training and protocols**, particularly for **high-risk phases** (approach and landing) and **adverse weather management**.

3. **Purpose of Flight Strategy:**
   Invest in **commercial/public flights** which have lower accident frequencies, reducing overall business risk exposure.
