# Aviation Accident Analysis Project

## **Overview**

The project explores aircraft accidents data from 1962 to 2023 to generate insights for a company deciding to invest in the aviation industry. The decision is made based on operational safety recommendations.

* **Data Source:** Kaggle (National Transportation Safety Board dataset)
* **Main scope:** Civil aviation accidents in the US, its territories, and international waters

---

## **Data Cleaning and Preparation**

The dataset was cleaned by:

* Handled the missing values using the mode or filling in with "Missing"
* Removed the outliers using the IQR method
* Narrowed the focus to top aircraft makes and models for clear insights and recommendations for the company
* Analyzing the engine types, weather conditions, and purpose of flight for operational context

---

## **Key Findings**

* Accident frequency has decreased over the years, indicating improving safety standards
* Some aircraft makes and models have higher accident frequencies, but also higher uninjured passenger counts. This suggests robust safety features
* Weather conditions and flight phases= significantly impact safety outcomes
* Engine type and the purpose of flight influence the rate of accidents

## **Recommendations**

1. Choosing the aircraft 
   Prioritize aircraft makes, models, and engine types with high uninjured passenger counts, indicating stronger safety performance.

2. The Operational Focus
   Enhance pilot training and protocols, particularly for high-risk phases and adverse weather management.

3. Purpose of Flight Strategy
   Invest in commercial/public flights, which have lower accident frequencies. This reduces overall business risk for the company.
